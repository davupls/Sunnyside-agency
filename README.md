## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

- Study the layout for all devices
- Structure html to make it simple to replicate

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript DOM manipulation

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
window.addEventListener("resize", function(){
    if (viewport > 500) {
        viewport = this.window.innerWidth
        arrowImage.width = viewport / 40;
        console.log("Viewport: ", viewport, "\nArrow: ", arrowImage.width);
    } else {
        console.log("Something is wrong.")
    }
})
};
```

### Continued development

- Tablet screen can be refined more
